  <p>Similar to my work with <a href="/posts/palo-alto.html">Palo Alto University</a>, I was contracted to design and develop a few new features for the popular Fretboard Journal's Drupal site. I had not had much prior experience with Drupal at this point, but with the help of the project lead and some quick learning, I was able to complete the job on schedule. During my work for Fretboard Journal, I was thrown into the waters of team collaboration by using Git to track code changes and manage new features by using branches. It was hectic at first, but since working on this website, I use Git for every project that I work on.</p>

  <p>Being a guitar player, and a fan of guitars in general, it was an honor to work on this website. A few years after my work with Fretboard Journal, they redesigned their website and switched to WordPress, but I'm grateful for being able to get some experience with Drupal while I could!</p>
