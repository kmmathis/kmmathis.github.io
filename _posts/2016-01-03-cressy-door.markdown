<h2>To the rescue!</h2>
<p>The Cressy Door website is one project of many in a group that I like to call "rescue" work. In a nutshell, Cressy had paid for a website to be completed by a less than reputable company. The work this company was producing was shoddy at best, and ultimately they couldn't deliver to Cressy Door what had been asked of them. Completely frustrated (and several months past the deadline), Cressy Door contracted me to fix and finish their website.</p>

    <h2>Getting it done</h2>

    <p>I spent a good deal of time going through the previous developer's code and stripping out all the bad bits, cleaning up what I could, and writing new code and styles to finish up the site. Being that the site was built on WordPress, the most challenging task was building Cressy's gallery system that allows users to find doors by style and brand. By extending WordPress' built in category and taxonomy features, and with some templating magic, I was able to build the galleries that Cressy had wanted, and they were also fully responsive!</p>
