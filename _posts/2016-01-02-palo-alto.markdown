  <p>I was contracted to do some design and development work for Palo Alto University and their Drupal-based website. I worked closely with the PAU team and a graphic designer to re-make their homepage and many of the interior pages for their curriculum offerings and staff areas. One of the concerns with working on this site was making sure it was accessible to all visitors, so I made sure to follow all the best accessibility and screen-reader software practices.</p>
  <p>Not having worked with Drupal before, I had a lot of fun learning how it worked. I also learned a lot more about Git on this project, as I was working closely with another developer on new features. It was quite the experience dipping my toes into new technology on a website that is visited by so many people!</p>
