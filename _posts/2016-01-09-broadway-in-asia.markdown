<h2>From design documents to a working website</h2>
<p>The creators of Broadway in Asia needed a simple, sleek website to showcase their shows for promoting their ventures into Asia. I used their pamphlets and branding material as inspiration to design and build a WordPress powered website that enabled them to add all of their shows, complete with a cool Google Images-like gallery. Adding in photos and videos for each of the shows is easy to do from the Dashboard, and adds greatly to the value of the website.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Responsive</h2>

    <p>My goal when making websites is to make them mobile-ready right from the beginning. I adopt the "mobile-first" approach, where I develop the website for small screens first before expanding the layout for bigger screens. For Broadway in Asia, the tricky part was getting the galleries of shows to look and respond well on mobile devices, but with a bit of tinkering it came together great. The accompanying video shows the site in action on a mobile device.</p>

    <h2>That's all, folks</h2>
  <p>Broadway in Asia was a very fun project, and came together rather quickly. I had a great time going through their preexisting branding materials and picking out colors and design elements to construct a page design that the client was happy with.</p>
