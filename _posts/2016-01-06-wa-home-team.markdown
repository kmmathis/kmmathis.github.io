<h2>Web apps and APIs!</h2>
<p>I worked as designer and front-end developer on a small team tasked with creating a real estate search engine and CRM prototype. The gist of the project was that we would create a property search website that would query a server populated with listings from the NWMLS system. If a visitor decided to sign up on the website, they were added to a list of leads in an agent's CRM where they could further follow up and track interactions with that visitor.</p>
<p>The search website was built in PHP using the Laravel framework, as well as Sass and jQuery to manage the styling and search interface. Ajax calls were made to a server running Java and Cassandra DB to deliver the property information to the screen for visitors to interact with. I used the Google Maps JavaScript API to plot the property data on a map for users to scroll and zoom and navigate.</p>
<p>The CRM was built using the Ember.js JavaScript framework. The framework was rather new at this point, and so we had to do a lot of learning and hard work to get things working. We did manage to figure it out though, and it was looking pretty slick before the decision was made to shut the project down. I hadn't thought to grab any screenshots or videos of the apps before the shutdown, but I did manage to find a backup of the search website on the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>

<p>Although this project didn't end up taking off, the things I learned from it are invaluable. Creating interactive JavaScript web apps was something I hadn't really done prior to this project, and my knowledge and skill as a developer improved greatly from the experience. I also worked closely with my team to design and implement a REST API from scratch. Figuring out how to format the API endpoints as well as the data response that the API returned was a challenge, but also a great learning experience.</p>
