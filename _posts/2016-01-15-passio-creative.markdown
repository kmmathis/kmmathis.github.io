<p>I worked with Heather Stajgr, owner of Passio Creative, to turn her vision for her website into a reality. She sent me a PSD that contained every single page of her website, designed right down to the finest detail. It was my job and challenge to create a WordPress theme that remained faithful to her design.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge with this project was that Heather had sent me a website design that looked great on a large monitor, but didn't take into account any smaller screens like tablets or phones. So with my imagination, and her feedback, I coaxed her design into a fluid-width, adaptive website - one that I am very proud of.</p>

<p>Another challenging part of this project was the typography. Heather is a print designer, so of course the type in her design document looked awesome; however, the font she chose was not available anywhere as a web font. I searched through a few of the popular web font providers for something similar, and ended up finding a typeface at TypeKit that was close enough to get the job done. TypeKit, combined with the use of CSS line-height and letter-spacing properties, helped me get the type as close to the original design as possible.</p>
